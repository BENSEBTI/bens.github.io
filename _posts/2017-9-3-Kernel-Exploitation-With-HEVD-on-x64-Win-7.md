---
I Have been and still learning Kernel exploitation , and i found a very interesting Kernel driver [HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Windows](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) Driver filled with different bugs to help people who like to learn kernel exploitation a deep and easy way to understand that . 

In this post we will focus on kernel stack overflow using C++ to write our exploit 

i'm still learning and there a big chance that i will make some mistakes or misunderstand some thing so don't hesitate to point that if it is the case ;) .

ok So first things first we will devide this tutorial in 3 parts 

1- setting up our envirenement .

2- Discovering the bug and writing the exploit .

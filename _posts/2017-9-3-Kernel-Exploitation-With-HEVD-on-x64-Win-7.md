published: true
---
I Have been and still learning Kernel exploitation , and i found a very interesting Kernel driver [HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Windows](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) Driver filled with different bugs to help people who like to learn kernel exploitation a deep and easy way to understand that . 

In this post we will focus on kernel stack overflow using C++ to write our exploit 

ok so first things first we will devide this tutorial in 3 parts 	:

1- setting up our environment .

2- Discovering the bug and bsod the system .

3 - Writing the exploit and explotation :) .

PS: i'm still learning and there a big chance that i will make some mistakes or misunderstand some thing so don't hesitate to point that if it is the case ;) .

## Setting up our environment

For this tutorial i'm using a x64 Windows 7 , running on VMWARE and the x64 HEVD

### Installing the Vulnerable driver

there is two way either compiling it or use the allready compiled one , i will chose the easy way (Compiled version)

you can download that from there github repo https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/releases/download/v1.20/HEVD.1.20.zip

and we will be using [OSR Driver Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=157)to install HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver
